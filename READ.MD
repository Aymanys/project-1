"Space Word Guess Game"
1- The first step is to create a list of space-related words along with their definitions that will be used as Hints I put them in the Constant Categories:
For example:
1 - "Galaxy": A system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter bound together by gravity.

- Randomly selecting the words and its related definitions.
- A placeholder to hold the letters

2- Displaying info of the game:

- Show the definition of the word.
- The words should be shown as empty (\_\_ \_\_ \_\_ \_\_), taking into consideration the numbers of letters.

3- Variables

- Incorrect number of guesses (5 wrong guesses)
- Number of trials (incorrect guesses)
- A placeholder to store the correct guesses

4- Loop:

- Input a letter

If correct
display should be updated

else

- number of incorrect answer (add to the counter)

Now the software should do the following:
1 - check if the player won (guessed the word).
2- check the player lost (Did not guesses the word).

5- Game Ending

- Player guessed the word (You Win!)
- Player used the 5 guesses (You lose! Fatality!)
