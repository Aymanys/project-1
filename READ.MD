**Letter Memory Game**
It is a simple letter memory game. At first, I tried using URL photos, but I found it a bit challenging to work with functions using URLs, and it would have required more time to accomplish. I decided on this approach to ensure it meets the minimum requirements for the project and to manage time effectively.

**The game is divided into the following sections:**

_Starting the Game:_ A function to clear the grid and reset matched letters. Boxes are created in an array with attached click events.
_Reveal Letters:_ A function to show a letter as soon as a box is clicked.
_Checking for Matches:_ A function to compare the first and second clicks on boxes. If there is a match, the match count is incremented; if not, the boxes return to a hidden state.
_Reset Function:_ Clears boxes and enables new clicks, allowing for the next round

> The hardest part of this project has been figuring out how to make the functions work together. Each function—like setting up the grid or checking for matches—has its own job, but making them fit together smoothly so the game works correctly has taken a lot of time and testing.
